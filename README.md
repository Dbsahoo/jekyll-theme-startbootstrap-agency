## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

The theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test the theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using the theme. Edit pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test the theme's contents. As you make modifications to the theme and to the content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
